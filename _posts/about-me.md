Hey there, I'm Philipp ðŸ‘‹

I love to learn and build stuff. Solving problems with technology is what I'm passionate about.

When I'm not in the implementation phase I deeply immerse myself into Math and Science, always trying to get out of the "comfort zone" to explore recent discoveries. While studying such topics I follow the [Feynman Technique](https://fs.blog/2012/04/feynman-technique/) and consolidate my learnings in blog posts and code I share on this personal blog and my [GitHub account](https://github.com/pmuens).

I worked at [Serverless, Inc.](http://serverless.com/) as an Open Source Engineer where I co-created the [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless), an Open Source tool which makes it easy to develop, manage and deploy serverless applications to different cloud providers.

Previously, I worked at my own startup where we built a video recruiting software called "hireTV" which bridged the communication gap between corporations and Generation Y during the hiring process.

Before that I studied Computer Science and worked at [IBM](http://ibm.com/) on projects ranging from SAP consultancy, Linux kernel driver development for S/390 architectures to web portal integrations for a German car manufacturer.

## Work

The following is a list of projects I've been involved with over the last couple of years. It's just an excerpt of what I'd consider noteworthy. Feel free to check out my [GitHub account](https://github.com/pmuens) to see more Open Source projects.

### Interlayer

- [Homepage](https://interlayer.io)

I'm a huge fan of blogging. It's a great way to share your knowledge and talk about the things that matter to you. As a writer there's always the challenge to effectively reach your target audience. Sure, there's SEO but do you really want to play that game and wait months or years until you're writing content that pleases your search engine of choice? Switching to the readers point of view it gets harder and harder to discover good, valuable content which isn't optimized for search engine rankings or clicks.

In order to solve those two problems I built [Interlayer](https://interlayer.io) which is a Widget you can embed easily on your website or blog.

Once embedded, Interlayer uses advanced Machine Learning techniques to crawl, analyze and understand the websites content. When a visitor reaches the end of a post or page the Widget will be displayed, recommending complementary content based on the users interests from other sites using Interlayer.

Your readers will be delighted to find the next story they can immerse themselves into while you refer and receive interested visitors from your target audience.

### Serverless Framework

- [Homepage](https://serverless.com/cli/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/serverless/serverless)

The Serverless Framework is a CLI tooling written in JavaScript which helps you develop, manage and deploy serverless applications to the Cloud.

I worked on the project as a contributor in it's `v0` days where it had ~ 5.000 GitHub starts. Shortly thereafter I joined [Serverless, Inc.](https://serverless.com) and helped re-designing the project from scratch, resulting in what is now known as the Serverless Framework `v1`, amassing more than 33.000 GitHub stars along the way.

### Serverless Components

- [Homepage](https://serverless.com/components/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/serverless/components)

[Serverless Components](https://serverless.com/components/) make it easy to build use-case focused serverless applications by re-using and composing self-contained building blocks. Such components can range from a simple AWS Lambda component to a more sophisticated Web-Backend component (which internally orchestrates other components).

I designed and implemented the first version during a hackathon we held at [Serverless, Inc.](http://serverless.com/) Furthermore I was involved in several redesigns the project went through on its way to a production-grade product.

### Serverless Framework Enterprise

- [Homepage](https://serverless.com/enterprise/)

Serverless Framework Enterprise is a companion [tool suite](https://serverless.com/dashboard/) which helps operating and collaborating on large scale serverless deployments.

I worked on the communication and integration between external applications such as the Serverless Framework and the backend cloud infrastructure. In particular I architected and implemented the state storage layer, ensuring that deployment state is versioned and fast to store and retrieve.

### Sled

- [GitHub](https://github.com/spacejam/sled)

Sled is a modern embedded key-value database written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

While learning Rust I implemented a simple benchmarking solution to analyze Sleds throughput.

### Pipeline

- [GitHub](https://github.com/pmuens/pipeline)

Pipeline is a CI / CD solution written in JavaScript which runs your CI / CD pipeline locally in Docker containers.

I decided to implement this project after being frustrated with the slow feedback loop using existing CI / CD solution.

### James

- [GitHub](https://github.com/pmuens/james)

James is a simplistic note taking application which makes it possible to quickly jot down, save and easily retrieve ideas.

James was built as an internal tool at my startup and acted as the single source of truth for notes which were shared among our team.

### Scalable

- [Homepage](http://sclbl.com/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/sclbl)

Scalable is a modularized system which makes it possible to build software solutions tailored to specific business needs.

After seeing the problems with existing business software suites I decided to implement a system which makes it possible to compose existing, self-contained modules into larger applications.

### Collablearn

- [GitHub](https://github.com/pmuens/collablearn)

Collablearn is a collaborative learning environment which helps students study together to prepare for their exams and finals.

Collablearn was built to scratch my own itch while I studied Computer Science where some classes required us to memorize lots of facts in a short period of time. From day one it supported an offline and mobile optimized learning experience, making it possible to take some quizzes while waiting in line or riding the bus.
